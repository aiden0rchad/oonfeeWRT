# Where this project is

Written 2026-08-13 as a handoff. Updated the same day when Phase 0 finished,
and again when Phase 1's read-only fleet view came up. Everything below is
either committed or measured on real hardware; nothing here is aspiration.

## 1. The short version

The design is no longer a design. It was validated against a real
**Linksys WRT3200ACM running OpenWrt 25.12.5**, which corrected several
assumptions, and then **Phases 0 and 1 were built in Go and TypeScript** against
those findings.

**Phase 0 is complete** — transport, capability probing, adoption, the
apply/rollback/confirm cycle, the credential store, the poll loop.

**Phase 1's read-only fleet view runs end to end.** Poll a real device, roll the
samples into SQLite, serve them through an authenticated API, and render them in
a browser: dashboard, devices with charts, the client grid, logs. 92 KB of UI
gzipped against a 1.5 MB budget.

Thirteen Go packages plus a UI, all tested; nine verified against the device
rather than only against the mock.

## 2. The test device

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | Linksys WRT3200ACM, OpenWrt 25.12.5 r33051 (mvebu/cortexa9, class A) |
| Reached at | `192.168.1.1` over ethernet from the dev Mac at `192.168.1.181` (`en9`) |
| Root access | SSH key auth works; **root has no password set** |
| WAN | up, on the UniFi-routed `10.7.46.0/24` |
| Radios | both enabled, `oonfeewrt-probe-2g` / `oonfeewrt-probe-5g`, WPA2 |

**Our footprint on it right now:** `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/oonfeewrt.json`, one
`rpcd` login (`oonfeewrt`, password in the session scratchpad — regenerate if
lost, see §7), two empty scratch configs, and **nlbwmon** (installed to test the
tier-2 path; `apk del nlbwmon` removes it).

Running the hardware tests:

```bash
OONFEE_TEST_HOST=192.168.1.1 OONFEE_TEST_USER=oonfeewrt OONFEE_TEST_PASS=... \
  go test -tags=integration -p 1 ./internal/... -run Integration -timeout 400s
```

`-p 1` is **required**: packages otherwise run in parallel against one device,
and one package's armed rollback makes another's login shared (see §4).

The suite now includes `internal/collector` (a real poll under the scoped
credential, which is where a missing ACL grant shows up) and `internal/daemon`
(the sealed credential opening a real session, and the collector writing
`last_seen` back to SQLite).

| `internal/reconcile` | Read → render → diff → apply → record | mock only |
| `internal/secrets` | argon2id → XChaCha20-Poly1305; operator passwords | ✅ end to end |
| `internal/collector` | The poll loop: two tiers, batching, backoff, quiesce | ✅ |
| `internal/telemetry` | RAM ring → 5m → 1h, counter/ratio arithmetic | ✅ |
| `internal/api` | REST, session auth, CSRF, login throttle | ✅ |

| `cmd/oonfeewrtd` | The entrypoint | ✅ runs |
| `ui/` | Vite + React SPA, embedded via `go:embed` | ✅ driven in a browser |

Also: `tools/probe.py` (hardware validation), `tools/mock_ubus.py` (the contract
fixture — it reproduces the measured semantics, including the awkward ones),
`deploy/acl/oonfeewrt.json` (the entire device-side footprint).

---

## 4. Measured device behaviour that the code depends on

These were discovered by measurement and several **contradicted the original
design**. Full detail in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §14; this is the short list
for someone picking the work up.

**The apply path**
- `uci.apply {rollback:true}` works and **reloads services** — an SSID change was
  observed changing on air and reverting on air.
- `uci.apply` returns **status 0 even when the applied config kills the service**
  (an invalid dnsmasq port applied cleanly while DNS died). Status is not health.
- Health must therefore run **before** confirm, while the timer is still armed:
  a failed change then costs nothing, because we simply decline to confirm.
- `uci.confirm` **and** `uci.rollback` are bound to the session that applied.
- `uci.apply` is one **all-or-nothing transaction** across every staged config,
  and is **globally serialised** — a second session's armed apply is refused with
  status 6, which means "already armed", *not* an authorization failure.
- **An armed rollback does not survive an rpcd restart.** The change stays
  applied and unconfirmable. This is why outcomes are three-valued.
- After a rollback, the applying session still reads the value it **failed** to
  set; a fresh session reads the reverted one.
- **While a rollback is armed, `session.login` returns the applying session's
  token to any caller.** So an independent session is unavailable inside the
  window, and destroying "the verification session" destroys the applier's —
  which silently reverts a healthy change. `FreshSession` marks these `Shared()`
  and `Destroy` refuses to act on them.

**ACLs and denials**
- `list read '*'` is **not** a superuser. It expands only over access-groups
  defined on disk.
- `uci` grants are **two-dimensional**: methods under `"ubus"` *and* config names
  under a sibling `"uci"` key. Both must match.
- `file.exec` matches the command **resolved to its absolute path**.
- File paths are **canonicalised** before matching and `*` **crosses `/`** — so a
  `/sys/class/net/*` grant never fires, while `/sys/devices/*` grants a subtree.
- **ubus status 6** = session valid, target refused → permanent, never retry.
  **JSON-RPC −32002** = rpcd refused to proxy → ambiguous (dead session *or*
  ungranted method) → exactly one re-login disambiguates.
- An rpcd restart destroys every session. Adoption avoids one: rpcd re-reads
  both the ACL dir and the login config at session-creation time.

**Telemetry**
- `iwinfo` is ~92% of a focused poll (194 ms vs 15.8 ms without it).
  `hostapd.<iface>` is ~30× cheaper for per-AP status, but **not** a substitute
  for `assoclist`, which alone carries `tx.retries`, `connected_time`,
  `signal_avg`, `noise`, `thr`.
- `hostapd.rate` is **100×** `iwinfo.rate`. Never mix them.
- Three mwlwifi quirks, all *present but wrong*: `rx_time`/`tx_time` never
  advance (so interference and the airtime split are not computable); survey
  `noise` is **unsigned** (161 for −95); per-station `noise` swings **37 dB**
  between reads (so per-sample SNR flails).
- `network.wireless` is **entirely unreachable** through rpcd.
- uhttpd keep-alive is **20 s**; the ubus session idle timer is **300 s** and any
  call refreshes it.
- Zero flash writes under sustained polling. Software flow offload does **not**
  break per-client accounting.
- **The two poll tiers are worth their complexity**, measured through the real
  collector under the scoped credential, best of five, each one batched request:
  **baseline 8 ms for 7 calls, focused 116 ms for 11.** A 14× difference for
  four extra calls is the whole argument for fetching `iwinfo` only while
  somebody is looking.
- **`iwinfo.survey`'s `busy_time` and `active_time` are COUNTERS with different
  epochs.** Both advance correctly, but their absolute values are not
  comparable, so utilization is Δbusy/Δactive and never the ratio of absolutes.
  Measured: 5 GHz absolute 1354.7 % against delta 1.7 %; 2.4 GHz absolute 25.9 %
  against delta **73.3 %** — the dangerous one, because 25.9 % looks entirely
  reasonable and is wrong by 3×. hostapd's independent BSS-load reading settled
  it. This corrected a claim asserted as verified in three documents.
- **The client inventory is cheap.** `luci-rpc.getHostHints` 5.1 ms,
  `getDHCPLeases` 2.9 ms; adding both took the baseline poll from 8 ms to 11 ms
  batched. `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` is **128.8 ms** — as expensive as an
  entire focused poll — so it belongs to adoption and must never enter a poll.
- **The noise floor is a per-radio capability, and changing source does not
  rescue it.** The documented advice was "`iwinfo.survey` reports noise
  unsigned, so read it from `iwinfo.info`" — right about the encoding, silent
  about trust. Over 20 samples the 2.4 GHz radio swung **42 dB through
  `iwinfo.info` and 46 dB through `iwinfo.survey`**, while the 5 GHz radio on
  the same driver held within 7 dB. Channel busy time does not explain it.
  `Radio.NoiseStable` now gates it per radio, and the detector is asymmetric:
  a disagreement proves the value moves, agreement proves nothing.

## 5. What to do next

Phase 0 is done. **Phase 1 is functionally done for the data the controller
collects** — inventory, telemetry, API, UI — with the gaps below.

**Finish Phase 1:**

1. **Adoption has no UI.** A device gets into the inventory only through
   `internal/daemon/seed_helper_test.go`. The adoption *mechanism* is built and
   tested (`internal/adoption`); what is missing is discovery, the operator
   credential prompt, and a screen. This is the largest remaining gap and the
   one a new user hits first.
2. **The WebSocket** (`/api/v1/live`, IMPLEMENTATION §8). The UI currently
   polls the API every 10 s, which is honest but wasteful and adds latency the
   focused tier was supposed to remove.
3. **The resource-budget harness** (DEVICE-BUDGET §7): an hour of baseline and
   focused polling against a class-C device asserting CPU, RAM, request rate and
   zero flash writes. It is in the Phase 1 list and is not built. Everything
   measured so far is a single poll's cost, not a sustained one.
4. **Client-list scoping.** The grid lists every host the device sees, which on
   a WAN-facing gateway includes the upstream network's ARP neighbours. Telling
   LAN from WAN needs the site model to know what a LAN is, so this is really a
   Phase 3 dependency — but it is visible now and worth stating.
5. **Virtualized rows and column customization** (UI-SPEC §5). The grid renders
   every row; fine at 8 clients, not at the 10k the spec anticipates for Logs
   and Flows.

**Open items that need hardware I do not have:**
- Class B/C devices. **Class C (MT7621) sets the budget** and every number so
  far comes from the comfortable class — TLS alone doubled poll CPU there.
- Hardware flow offload (mvebu has none), so the README's accounting tradeoff
  remains scoped to hardware offload and untested.
- A second device, for genuine fleet behaviour. The stagger, the per-device
  backoff and the "ten devices at 60 s is one request every 6 s" rule are all
  unit-tested and none of them has met a second real router.
- **A 32-bit interface counter.** The wrap-recovery path in
  `internal/telemetry/counter.go` is unit-tested but has never seen a real wrap:
  determining the reference device's counter width needed 3 GB pushed through
  it. The code is written to be correct either way.

**Known gaps worth closing cheaply:**
- `internal/model` has no tests of its own (it is exercised through `render`).
- `adoption` and `reconcile` are mock-verified only. An integration test for
  adoption against the real device would be worth having, but it writes a real
  login, so it needs a deliberate decision.
- The UI has no tests. It was verified by driving a browser against the live
  device, which caught two rendering bugs no unit test would have.

---

## 6. Working practices that earned their place

Stated because they repeatedly caught real bugs, including bugs I had already
written and believed.

- **A refused check is not a negative answer.** Denied vs absent must stay
  distinct. Conflating them made `probe.py` report "no DSA" and "legacy
  iptables" for a device that has both, and the same class of bug reappeared
  three times afterwards — twice inside code written to prevent it.
- **Presence-probing cannot detect a field that is present and wrong.** Three
  mwlwifi quirks needed *re-reading* to find. Anything that decides a capability
  from one sample is guessing.
- **Verify with the rawest source available.** Reading "on disk" with `uci get`
  (which overlays a pending delta) produced a confident, wrong finding that was
  committed before being caught.
- **A measurement script that cannot distinguish a failed call from an empty
  result will eventually report a failure as data.** That produced a 131-second
  "divergence" that did not exist.
- **Mock-green is not hardware-green.** The mock passed throughout while real
  hardware exposed the shared-session bug that reverted healthy changes.
- **A fix for one defect is not a fix for the next one in the same field.**
  "`iwinfo.survey` reports noise unsigned, so read it from `iwinfo.info`" was
  written up as settled and repeated in four documents. It settles the encoding
  and says nothing about whether the value can be trusted — which, on the 2.4
  GHz radio, it cannot, from either source. The advice was not wrong; it was
  answering a different question than the one a reader would use it for.
- **Run it and look at it.** Four defects in Phase 1 survived a green test
  suite and died within minutes of a browser pointing at the real thing:
  firmware never persisted, client IPs collected and dropped, every page load
  301-ing, and a chart axis labelled with years for data from that afternoon.
  Tests check what you thought to assert; opening the page checks what is
  actually there.
- **Say what a check proves, not what it suggests.** The noise-stability
  detector fires on a disagreement and stays silent on agreement, so silence is
  not evidence. On one hardware run the survey pair agreed while the
  `iwinfo.info` pair jumped 45 dB — same radio, same minute. `Present` therefore
  means "not caught misbehaving", and the code, the docs and the field name all
  say so, because a future reader will otherwise round it to "verified".

## 7. Practical notes

- Go 1.26.5 installed via Homebrew (`brew uninstall go` to reverse). The module
  requires **go 1.25** because `modernc.org/sqlite` does, above
  `IMPLEMENTATION.md` §1's stated "Go ≥ 1.23" floor.
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compiles cleanly for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` —
  verified, and the reason decision D3 chose that driver.
- The device credential lives in the session scratchpad. If lost, delete
  `rpcd.oonfeewrt` on the device and re-run adoption, or regenerate a `$6$` hash
  with `internal/crypt` and write it into `/etc/config/rpcd`.
- Running the daemon from a checkout:

  ```bash
  go run ./cmd/oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

  It prompts for an operator passphrase on a terminal (twice on first run,
  because a typo there is a keyring nobody can open), or reads one from a mode
  0600 file given by `-passphrase-file` / `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE_FILE`. It refuses a
  passphrase in `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE` — env is readable from `/proc`, inherited by
  children, and printed by `docker inspect`. The data directory is created 0700
  and holds `keyring.json` plus `oonfeewrt.db`.

- Building and running the whole thing:

  ```bash
  npm --prefix ui install && npm --prefix ui run build && ./tools/budget_check.sh
  ```

  Then `go run ./cmd/oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080`
  and open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. The Go binary embeds `ui/dist`; building
  without it still works and serves an explanation instead of a blank page.
  `npm --prefix ui run dev` proxies /api to a daemon on :8080 for UI work.

- Adoption has no CLI yet, so seeding a device by hand means sealing its
  credential with `Keeper.SealCredential(mac, user, pass)` and writing a
  `store.Device` with `AdoptedAt` set. `internal/daemon/integration_test.go`
  does exactly that and is the shortest working example.

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §14 is the authoritative record of measured
  behaviour. When code and docs disagree, the measurement wins — and if neither
  matches the device, re-measure before changing either.
